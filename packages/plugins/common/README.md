# Express Tool Common Plugin

The Common plugin provides essential utilities and middleware that are fundamental to any production-grade Express.js application generated by `express-tool`.

## Installation

This plugin is a standard part of the `express-tool` scaffolding. To install manually:

```bash
npm install @express-tool/plugin-common
```

## Features

- **Logger**: Configured `pino` logger for high-performance structured logging.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized global error handling middleware (`AppError` class and handler).
- **Core Middleware**: Configures `helmet`, `cors`, and `express-rate-limit` for security and stability.
- **Environment config**: Sets up `dotenv` for environment variable management.

## Usage

This plugin generates:

- `utils/logger.ts`: The logger instance.
- `middleware/errorHandler.ts`: The global error handling logic.
